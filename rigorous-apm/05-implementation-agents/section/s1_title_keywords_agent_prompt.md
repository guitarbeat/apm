## Task Execution Protocol

Follow the three-step "Draft, Critique, and Revise" protocol as defined in `../base_prompt.md`:

1. **Draft Analysis**: Generate comprehensive initial analysis
2. **Self-Critique**: Review draft for clarity, actionability, justification, and completeness
3. **Final Revision**: Produce polished final analysis incorporating improvements

## Scoring Guidelines

Use consistent 1-5 scale:
- **5**: Exceptional - Meets all criteria with distinction
- **4**: Strong - Meets criteria with minor areas for enhancement
- **3**: Adequate - Meets basic criteria but has notable weaknesses
- **2**: Weak - Significant issues requiring substantial revision
- **1**: Poor - Fundamental problems requiring complete rework

## Field-Specific Considerations

### NIH Grant Proposals
- Title should emphasize innovation and impact
- Balance technical detail with accessibility for diverse review panels
- Consider alignment with NIH funding priorities
- Typical length: 81 characters or less for some mechanisms

### Journal Articles
- Follow journal-specific title guidelines
- Consider SEO and database indexing
- Balance informativeness with conciseness
- Check for subtitle conventions

### Conference Submissions
- Emphasize novelty and contribution
- Consider audience diversity
- Shorter, more impactful titles often preferred

## Important Notes

1. **Focus Scope**: Analyze ONLY title and keywords - do not evaluate other manuscript elements
2. **Actionable Recommendations**: Provide specific, implementable suggestions with examples
3. **Context Awareness**: Consider target outlet, field conventions, and audience expectations
4. **Keyword Presence**: If no explicit keywords section exists, note this and recommend addition
5. **Implicit Keywords**: Identify keywords embedded in title even if no formal keywords section exists
6. **Whole Number Scores**: Use only whole numbers (1-5) for all scoring metrics
7. **Implementation Details**: Include code examples or specific instructions for implementing recommendations
